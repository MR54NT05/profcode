            Let me take, let me take you there<br>
            You see I've been around the globe<br>
            I've seen a lot, seen a lot babe<br>

            I wanna see what's below<br>
            Just tell me where you wanna go<br>
            You can name the place, yeah<br>
            You can name the time<br>
            We can leave it all behind<br>
            No stop or rewind<br>
            Before we're running out of time<br>
            I can see us both, flying to Rome<br>
            Chilling in a boat, right by the coast<br>
            I can see our clothes, down on the floor<br>
            I can see it all, baby we should go<br>
            Get set go, take off<br>
            Just tell me where you wanna go<br>
            North pole, East, West, baby I'll go anywhere<br>
            We'll take a plane or take a boat<br>
            I don't really care, just as long as it will get us there<br>
            'Cause I wanna see what's above<br>
            I wanna see what's below<br>
            Just tell me where you wanna go<br>
